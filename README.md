# ofcourse
React + golang + postgres + docker

This project was built to showcase an app built using a few cool technologies.
I've only implemented basic user management stuff in terms of actual features, but this scaffolding can be extended to serve a huge variety of purposes.

I thought other people might be interested in the same stack, so it's open source.

# Front-End Goodies
- React (un-ejected create-react-app)
- Semantic UI
- Unstated (alternative to redux)

# Back-End Goodies
- golang
- postgres
- docker
